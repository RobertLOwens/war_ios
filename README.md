Slow-paced RTS IOS Strategy Medival War Game

Strategy games are my favorite. I love lining up against a competitor and dueling it out. Wit, tactical positioning, information, resource management, and speed all come together to create an experience of either winning or losing against your opponent. Yes, there might be randomness, but your decisions are the driver of whether you win or lose.

I work a lot, so I don’t often get to sit down and play some of the games I enjoy on PC. All I have is 5 to 10 minutes on my phone every so often. I picked up and spent hours into the massive multiplayer strategy war mobile games. They had a ton of really fun features that are really unique: massive maps, resources and bonuses to fight over, diplomacy, and tactical positioning.

They all have one massive problem. Pay to win. The more money you spend, the more you can speed up production, gather resources, or get access to rare items. Most of these games have some sort of “chest” where you can put money in and see what comes out. The rarest items in the game have really low drop rates. So if you play these games without spending, your chances of getting them are slim and then at a disadvantage against players who drop thousands of dollars to gain an overpowered advantage in a mobile strategy game. Sounds silly, I know.

At the end of the day, they are gambling games. You pay money for the opportunity to get the best heroes, troops, and items the game has to offer. That’s just not fun. After spending hours to “grind” to keep up with the players, you line up with your tactical army that should have some advantage, but the bonuses from spending more outweigh any decision a free to play player can make.

So, I’m off to make something new, something different, and something fair that everyone can enjoy.
